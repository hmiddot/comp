# comp
Bring components into non-react projects with a few short lines<br>
for example you add this code at first of your code:
```
<define name="post">
    <button>{text=hello}</button>
</define>
```
<br>
and it will be avaiable once you use:
<br>
```
<post text="hi"></post>
```
<br>
it's only this :)
